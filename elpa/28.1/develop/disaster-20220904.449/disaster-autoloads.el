Show assembly code for current line of C/C++ file.

Here's the logic path it follows:

- Is there a complile_commands.json in this directory? Get the object file
  name for the current file, and run it associated command.
- Is there a Makefile in this directory? Run `make bufname.o`.
- Or is there a Makefile in a parent directory? Run `make -C .. bufname.o`.
- Or is this a C file? Run `cc -g -c -o bufname.o bufname.c`
- Or is this a C++ file? Run `c++ -g -c -o bufname.o bufname.c`
- If build failed, display errors in compile-mode.
- Run objdump inside a new window while maintaining focus.
- Jump to line matching current line.

If FILE and LINE are not specified, the current editing location
is used.
